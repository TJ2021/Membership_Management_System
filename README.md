# Membership Management System

This application serves as a foundational membership management system for a fitness center. The center encompasses three distinct locations: Club Mercury, Club Neptune, and Club Jupiter. Membership is categorized into two types: Single Club Membership and Multi Club Membership.

Single Club Members are granted access exclusively to one of the three clubs, while Multi Club Members enjoy privileges across all three establishments. Membership fees vary based on membership type and, for Single Club Members, the specific club they are affiliated with.

Additionally, Multi Club Members receive incentives in the form of membership points upon registration. Initially, each Multi Club Member is credited with 100 points, which can be utilized to acquire goods and beverages from the center's store.

To efficiently manage member data, this application employs a MySQL database, ensuring the seamless storage and retrieval of member information.
